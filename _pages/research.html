I develop <b>mathematical and machine learning tools for scientific applications</b>, with a focus on nonequilibrium plasma flows. My work combines physics-informed models, reduced-order methods, and scalable surrogate architectures, <b>bridging applied mathematics and engineering</b> to enable fast, reliable simulations for real-world applications.
