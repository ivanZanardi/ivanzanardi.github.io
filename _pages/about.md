I‚Äôm **Ivan Zanardi**, a PhD candidate in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My research focuses on combining machine learning and model reduction to accelerate and enhance simulations of high-speed, reactive, and plasma flows.

My goal is to develop **fast, accurate, and physics-aware simulation tools** for real-world engineering problems, especially in hypersonics and aerothermodynamics.

### üéØ Research Interests
- Surrogate modeling of thermochemical systems (e.g., **MENO** framework)
- Physics-informed neural operators (PINOs)
- GPU-accelerated integrators (e.g., **BDF with autodiff**)
- Operator learning and reduced-order modeling for multiphysics systems

### üìç Currently
- Working in Prof. Marco Panesi's group at [CHESS](https://chess.aerospace.illinois.edu/)
- Presenting research to NASA, DoD, and attending ML4PS @ NeurIPS
- Open to roles in national labs or research-focused industry
