<!-- 
Welcome! I am a data scientist applying machine learning tools and causal
inference techniques to remote sensing data. I am an affiliated
researcher with the [Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project](https://dapp-lab.org)
and a research collaborator with the 
[Research on International Policy Implementation Lab](https://bridgingthegapproject.org/ripil).

I earned my PhD in Political Science from the
[University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) and my
BA in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu).
My academic work has been [published](publications) in the
*American Political Science Review*, *International Studies Quarterly*,
*Conflict Management and Peace Science*, and
*Political Science Research and Methods*, among other outlets. This
[research](research) explores the causes and consequences of political violence
using a broad variety of methods such as latent variable models, geospatial
analysis, and big data. I have [taught](teaching) quantitative methodology and
international relations, and am a certified instructor with
[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org).

I‚Äôm **Ivan Zanardi**, a PhD candidate in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My research focuses on combining machine learning and model reduction to accelerate and enhance simulations of high-speed, reactive, and plasma flows.

My goal is to develop **fast, accurate, and physics-aware simulation tools** for real-world engineering problems, especially in hypersonics and aerothermodynamics.

### üéØ Research Interests
- Surrogate modeling of thermochemical systems (e.g., **MENO** framework)
- Physics-informed neural operators (PINOs)
- GPU-accelerated integrators (e.g., **BDF with autodiff**)
- Operator learning and reduced-order modeling for multiphysics systems

### üìç Currently
- Working in Prof. Marco Panesi's group at [CHESS](https://chess.aerospace.illinois.edu/)
- Presenting research to NASA, DoD, and attending ML4PS @ NeurIPS
- Open to roles in national labs or research-focused industry
