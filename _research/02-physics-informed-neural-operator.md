[**Physics-informed neural operators (PINOs)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03794) are a class of machine learning models designed to learn **mappings between function spaces**, unlike conventional neural networks which learn mappings between finite-dimensional vector spaces. While classical NNs approximate input-output relationships at discrete points, **neural operators learn how entire input functions map to output functions**, making them well-suited to modeling physical systems described by differential equations. PINOs go further by **embedding governing physical laws directly into the architecture or loss function**, enforcing residuals from PDEs or ODEs during training. This physics-constrained approach improves generalization, reduces data requirements, and ensures **physically consistent predictions**, even under extrapolation regimes.

My research applies PINOs to the **surrogate modeling of thermochemical reactive operators** in nonequilibrium, multicomponent plasma flows. These systems involve **stiff, coupled ODEs** that govern species population dynamics and energy exchanges via collisional-radiative kinetics and thermochemical nonequilibrium. Conventionally, these source terms are integrated using **implicit ODE solvers** at every grid point â€” a process that is accurate but **extremely costly** and limits simulation scalability.

Accurately resolving these operators requires solving high-dimensional, nonlinear systems repeatedly, making the approach **computationally prohibitive** in high-fidelity 2D or 3D simulations. PINOs allow us to build **fast surrogates** that approximate these operators with high accuracy while embedding the correct physical behavior. They offer **orders-of-magnitude speedups** and enable tight coupling with unsteady CFD solvers, unlocking new capabilities for real-time simulations.

### ðŸ”¬ Physics-Embedded Learning

In this context, PINOs are not simply data-driven regressors â€” they function as **physics-preserving surrogates**. The models are explicitly designed to:
- Enforce **mass and energy conservation laws**
- Maintain **positivity** of species concentrations and temperatures
- Preserve the **equilibrium distribution function** of species' quantum energy levels

This is not achieved by merely augmenting the loss function with physics-based residuals (e.g., from ODE constraints). Instead, the proposed PINO architectures **embed the governing equations directly into the network design itself**, yielding substantial improvements in accuracy while ensuring **physically consistent behavior** â€” even under strong extrapolation regimes.
